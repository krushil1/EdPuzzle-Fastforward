# Instructions
To run the script, simply open up inspect element, select the EdPuzzle frame and then go to console and paste the script and then finally press enter! Let the magic do it's own thing!

If your EdPuzzle contains a video from youtube, make sure to only set the speed to 3, otherwise it will glitch up and will keep playing the video at the same timestamp.
